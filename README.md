# Generate PDF for BioHackrXiv.org

We use pandoc with LaTeX templates to generate the PDF from markdown
that can be submitted to https://biohackrxiv.org/. Note we also have
an online tool that can do same http://preview.biohackrxiv.org/.

# Quick start

BioHackrXiv use [pandoc flavored markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). It is very simple. See

=> https://github.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-gen-pdf/blob/master/example/logic/paper.md

and the raw text version

=> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-gen-pdf/master/example/logic/paper.md

It *can* embed LaTeX because pandoc generates LaTeX from markdown as an intermediate step towards generating the final PDF.

The easiest start is to take the files in ./example/doc and modify them. Don't change the file names as they are used to generate the final paper. In fact, you can copy these files into your own git repo and continue from there.

We have a web interface that allows you to generate the PDF at

=> http://preview.biohackrxiv.org/

Paste in the base URL for your repo and the tool will find the paper.md.

Notes:

1. Do not paste the path to the paper itself - only the base repo URL.
2. One repo can not contain multiple paper.md's. It will pick the first one it finds.
3. For biohackathons it pays to add a template repo people can template from, e.g

# Introduction


Here you find the required steps to run to code on your own. There is also a [dockerized version](#run-via-docker).

If you find any bugs, please propose improvements via PRs. Thanks!

# Prerequisites

- ruby
- pandoc
- pandoc-citeproc
- pdflatex
- biblatex

Confirmed versions of the library can be found in [Dockerfile](https://github.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-gen-pdf/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile)

See also the Guix [script](.guix-deploy) for current dependencies.

# Install

Clone this git repository and install the prerequisites listed above

# Run

Generate the PDF with

    ./bin/gen-pdf [--debug] [dir] [output.pdf] [git-url]

where *dir* points to a directory where paper.md and paper.bib reside.
The event information is now taken directly from the markdown metadata fields:

- `biohackathon_name`: The name of the event (e.g., "NBDC/DBCLS BioHackathon")
- `biohackathon_url`: The URL of the event (e.g., "http://2019.biohackathon.org/")
- `biohackathon_location`: The location of the event (e.g., "Fukuoka, Japan, 2019")

For example from the repository try

    ./bin/gen-pdf example/logic/

which will generate the paper as *paper.pdf*.

# Run via Docker

Build docker container and run

    docker build -t biohackrxiv/gen-pdf:local -f docker/Dockerfile .
    docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/work -w /work biohackrxiv/gen-pdf:local gen-pdf /work/example/logic

Note that the current working directory of host machine is mounted on `/work` inside the container

# Run via GNU Guix

The [guix-deploy](./.guix-deploy) script starts a Guix container which allows running
the generator and tests. The instructions are in the header of that script.

# Bibliography hints

pandoc generates the bibliography (not biber or bibtex!).
You can inspect the intermediate .tex format (see below).

Importantly:

* Don't put references in literal markdown, such as surrounded by `backticks`!
* Don't use a colon in the reference ID because that has a special meaning in CITO

# Trouble shooting

If you are not using Docker or Guix you may need to explicitely add ruby

    ruby bin/gen-pdf [dir]

## First, run tests

    ruby -I lib test/test_generator.rb

## Next generate default example

    ruby ./bin/gen-pdf --debug ./example/logic
    ls -l example/logic/paper.pdf

and for debugging tex output:

    ruby ./bin/gen-pdf --debug ./example/logic output.tex
    ls -l example/logic/output.tex
    cd example/logic
    lualatex output.tex
    biber output.tex

Note that the svg figure may complain. Just hit enter.

## Next try generating your document using path

Clone your repo in to a visible path and

    git clone my-repo.git
    ruby ./bin/gen-pdf --debug my-repo-path/paper

If you get pandoc errors, such as `Unknown option --citeproc` you'll need a plugin.
Try the Guix container described above.

That should generate a PDF. To generate the latex file add it to the command and try

    ruby ./bin/gen-pdf --debug my-repo-path/paper output.tex

and now you can also debug the generated latex:

    cd example/logic
    lualatex output.tex
    biber output.tex # note that biber or bibtex won't work!

we find

    INFO - Found 0 citekeys in bib section 0

this is because the references are generated directly inline by pandoc. To test the bib file you can try

    pandoc-citeproc --bib2json paper.bib

and you can check the JSON records.
